# Credit_card_default_prediction
Overview: 
Bank A aims to improve its credit risk management framework by developing a forward-looking Behaviour Score — a classification model that predicts whether a credit card customer will default in the following month.
You are provided with anonymized historical behavioral data of over 30,000 credit card customers, with a labeled target variable: default . payment . next.month . This variable indicates whether a customer defaulted on their payment in the next billing cycle. The goal is to build a model that can accurately flag potential defaulters in advance, allowing the bank to adjust credit exposure, trigger early warning systems, and prioritize risk-based actions.
The goal is to go beyond prediction and create a financially interpretable model that helps the bank understand default patterns, take early action, and manage credit exposure.
Variables:
S.no
Column Headers	Explanations
1.	Customer Id	Unique identifier for each customer
2.	marriage	Marital status of the customer (1 = Married, 2 = Single, 3 = Others)
3.	sex	Gender of the customer (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
4.	education	Education level (1 = Graduate School, 2 = University, 3 = High School, 4 = Others)
5.	LIMIT_BAL	Credit limit assigned to the customer (in currency units)
6.	Age	Age of the customer (in years)
7.	Pay_m(Pay_0 to 6)	PAY_0 represents the payment status in the most recent month (Month 0), PAY_2 represents the payment status one month before that, and so on.Values:
8.	-2 = No credit consumption (no bill) in month m−1
9.	-1 = Bill generated and fully paid in month m−1 (same month payment)
     0= Partial or minimum payment made (revolving credit)
     ≥1 = Payment delayed by that many months (1 = 1 month overdue, etc.)
10.	Bill_amt_m(Bill_amt1 to 6)	Total bill amount at the end of month m (1 = last month, 6 = six months ago).
●	> 0 means customer owes money (paid less than previous bill)
●	 = 0 no spending
●	 < 0 customer overpaid previous bill (credit carried)

11.	Pay_amt_m(Pay_amt1 to 6)	Payment amount made in month m towards the bill generated in month m-1.
12.	AVG_Bill_amt	Average bill amount over the 6-month period 
13.	PAY_TO_BILL_ratio	Ratio of total payment to total bill amount over 6 months 
14.	next_month_default	Target variable : 1 if customer defaulted next month , 0 otherwise

How these link per month (example for month 5):
●	Bill_amt5 = bill generated at end of month 5 (say, May).

●	pay_amt5 = payment made in month 5 to cover bill from month 4 (April).

●	pay_5 = payment status in month 5, showing whether April’s bill was paid:

○	-1 means fully paid on time

○	0 means partial/minimum payment made

○	≥1 means payment overdue by that many months
Clarification:
1.For Payment Status = 0
It indicates that the customer did not pay the full amount due, but at least paid some minimum required amount to avoid being classified as overdue.

2.Small bill amounts with a payment status of -2 can occur due to residual charges, billing timing differences, or carryover balances from previous months.
Objectives:
●	Build a binary classification model to predict customer default (default.payment.next.month: 1 = Default, 0 = No Default).
●	Handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques (e.g., SMOTE, class weighting, downsampling).
●	Perform exploratory and financial analysis to understand how key behavioral variables influence default risk.
●	Go beyond basic EDA — analyze behavioral trends like payment delays, repayment consistency, and utilization
●	Engineer features and transformations that are financially meaningful and predictive like credit utilization ratio, delinquency streaks etc.
●	Test and compare multiple classification models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Ensemble Methods (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
●	Choose and justify evaluation metrics that reflect real-world credit risk trade-offs.
●	Set a classification threshold aligned with the bank’s risk appetite and discuss the business implications of false positives and false negatives.
●	Generate production-style predictions on an unlabeled validation dataset.
●	Ensure that predictions on the validation dataset are generated by maximizing the evaluation metric that best reflects credit risk priorities (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, AUC-ROC) through appropriate tuning of the classification threshold.
